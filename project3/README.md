### Final Project

This Python script allows you to view a directory and view each file within the directory, the file's size, and the percentage it takes up within the directory. After doing so, it also gives you a pie chart of the space taken up by each file in a more visual format. You will need to use matplotlib in order to run it, and you can install it with pip by using

'''python
pip install matplotlib
'''

You can download the python script and run it, it'll ask for the directory you want to view, and the script will work its magic! After it collects all the files and displaying a pie chart, closing the pie chart will ask you if you want to view another directory, and continue looping until you quit.

I believe this program is useful because it occupies a very nice feature, which is the ability to look up directories and see how much each file takes up in the directory compared to other files. There are other applications built that occupy the same idea, with a graphical interface. I used FileLight as a reference for my idea and went from there.
