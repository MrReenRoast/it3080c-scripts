### Project 2

This Python script allows you to view a directory and view each file within the directory, the file's size, and the percentage it takes up within the directory. The only required library you will need is os.
You can download the script and run it, it'll ask for the directory you want to view, and the script will work its magic! Have fun!
If just running the file causes it to close after putting it in a directory, run it through IDLE by right-clicking and editing with IDLE, then hitting run at the top or hitting F5 to run the script.
